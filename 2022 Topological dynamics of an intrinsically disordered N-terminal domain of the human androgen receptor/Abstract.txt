Human androgen receptor contains a large N-terminal domain (AR-NTD) that is highly dynamic and this poses a major challenge for experimental and computational 
analysis to decipher its conformation. Misfolding of the AR-NTD is implicated in prostate cancer and KennedyÂ´s disease, yet our knowledge of its structure is 
limited to primary sequence information of the chain and a few functionally important secondary structure motifs. Here, we employed an innovative combination 
of molecular dynamics simulations and circuit topology (CT) analysis to identify the tertiary structure of AR-NTD. We found that the AR-NTD adopts highly dynamic
loopy conformations with two identifiable regions with distinct topological make-up and dynamics. This consists of a N-terminal region (NR, residues 1 to 224) 
and a C-terminal region (CR, residues 225 to 538), which carries a dense core. Topological mapping of the dynamics reveals a traceable time-scale dependent 
topological evolution. NR adopts different positioning with respect to the CR and forms a cleft that can partly enclose the hormone-bound ligand-binding domain 
(LBD) of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, our data suggests a model in which dynamic NR and CR compete for binding to the DNA binding domain of the receptor,
thereby regulating the accessibility of its DNA binding site. Our approach allowed for the identification of a previously unknown binding site within the CR core,
revealing the structural mechanisms of action of AR inhibitor EPI-001, and paving the way for other drug delivery applications.
