## Topological dynamics of an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the human androgen receptor

**Summary**

Human androgen receptor contains a large N-terminal domain (AR-NTD) that is highly dynamic and this poses a major challenge for experimental and computational analysis to decipher its conformation. Misfolding of the AR-NTD is implicated in prostate cancer and Kennedy´s disease, yet our knowledge of its structure is limited to primary sequence information of the chain and a few functionally important secondary structure motifs. Here, we employed an innovative combination of molecular dynamics simulations and circuit topology (CT) analysis to identify the tertiary structure of AR-NTD. We found that the AR-NTD adopts highly dynamic loopy conformations with two identifiable regions with distinct topological make-up and dynamics. This consists of a N-terminal region (NR, residues 1 to 224) and a C-terminal region (CR, residues 225 to 538), which carries a dense core. Topological mapping of the dynamics reveals a traceable time-scale dependent topological evolution. NR adopts different positioning with respect to the CR and forms a cleft that can partly enclose the hormone-bound ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, our data suggests a model in which dynamic NR and CR compete for binding to the DNA binding domain of the receptor, thereby regulating the accessibility of its DNA binding site. Our approach allowed for the identification of a previously unknown binding site within the CR core, revealing the structural mechanisms of action of AR inhibitor EPI-001, and paving the way for other drug delivery applications.

### Description of the supplemental data

**File name:** 

FL_AR_minimized.pdb
FL_AR_minimized.psf

**File description:**

Full length AR structure constructed based on the NTD model reported in Sheikhhassani et al Protein Science (2022) (See Figure 6)). In order to construct it, full
length AR structure obtained from AlphaFold and after cleaving the NTD domain (residues 1 to 538) aligned to the NTD-LBD complex (See Figure XXX in the article). 
Full length construct was prepared in PDB and PSF formats. A PSF file, also called a protein structure file, contains all of the molecule-specific information needed
to apply a desired force field to the AR molecule for further analysis.
